# Distant Dreams

##About
Distance Dreams is an interactive piece that explores the fragility of memory. The participant is brought into a room that is cast into a dream-like state. Audio and footage of a distant picnic is mapped onto the body of someone you know. As you approach them details in the memory begin to loss rigidity, tesselate, and disassociate from the body.
